# Binary_Search_Tree

The implementation of a binary search tree, which functions simultaneously as maximum tree.

In the source code, implementation of insertion and deletion functions are included, as well as, Find_second_next and Print_between 
functions. Furthermore, implementation of the pre-order, in-order, post-order and level traversal, for easier control of the accuracy 
of the tree functions. The files, which were created for the operation of the implementation of this tree are the following: 
BnPTree.h, BnPTree.cpp and main.cpp.
